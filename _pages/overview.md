<p> 
Unnati (oo-n-uh-tee)  is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration (Marketing) at the Gies College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research lies at the intersection of mobile marketing, consumer mobility, and engagement in digital environments. Specifically, her research examines how consumers’ use of mobile apps affects their behaviors in online and offline retail stores. She also studies how consumers’ movement patterns predict their future retail visits and the impact of new forms of mobility (e.g., e-scooters) for both consumers and retailers. She uses causal modeling, econometrics, machine learning, and deep learning approaches to examine these research themes.

Unnati’s research has been published/accepted at Marketing Science, Journal of Marketing Research, the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, and Review of Marketing Research. She was awarded the 2019 Mathew Joseph Emerging Scholar Award, the 2019 PDMA Emerging Scholar Award, the 2019 Mays Business School Outstanding Doctoral Student Award for Research, and the 2018 Shankar-Spiegel Best Dissertation Proposal Award, the AMA Emerging Scholar Award (Retail and Pricing) 2022, and the AMA Doctoral Student Award (Retail and Pricing) 2022, and was the finalist for the EMAC-AiMark Doctoral Dissertation Award 2021.
